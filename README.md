# MathHub Lenses

### Intro
MathHub wants to be a public repository of mathematical knowledge and documents, which means everyone should be able to contribute. But it should also be a portal to high-quality material, which means some kind of quality control system. 
Following ideas developed for/by the [Connexions Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenStax_CNX) we want to employ a system of (named) "lenses", which give a reader (preferential) access to MathHub material endorsed by a set of chosen lenses. 

At its base, a **lens** *L* is just an endorsement list, i.e. a list of MathHub knowledge items endorsed as being of sufficient quality and/or interest by *L*. 

A MathHub reader can **adopt** a lens *L* for 
* **restriction**: MathHub content outside *L* (and other lenses adopted for restriction) is invisible to this user
* **preference**: the MathHub front-end prefers content in *L* (by some mechanism to be specified for resolving preferences between lenses)
